1 DSpace User = EPerson

Member API allows 2 to push to 3


To enable ORCID in DSpace
=========================

- don't need ORCID login
- enable Configurable Entities: Person, Publication, Project, OrgUnit
- - still some bugs with these!
- enable Researcher Profile
- Member API preferred
- researchers must connect local profiles with ORCID to get permission


On user profile page: link account to Person Item
- create public/private Person Item
- connect Person Item to ORCID with OAuth (3 steps)


- must actively use Researcher Profile (link to publications and other objects)
- must use Configurable Entities
- data must conform to ORCID schema and vocabularies
- only admins can import ORCID Persons
- Do not use DSpace's ORCID authority


** ORCID badges will only show if person has authenticated via ORCID **
and are not displayed for private Researcher Profiles
